# party-planner-app

## Why Pug Party Planner?

It's a simple app that is intended to teach me...
 - How to setup a Front end using:
   - Vuejs
   - Pug    - npm
   - Sass
 - How to setup a Backend using:
   - Java   - Maven
 - How to setup a database using:
   - Oracle DB 18c Express Edition
 - How to containerize each part of the app like:
   - Somthin simple like node for frontend
   - Tomcat 10 (backend)
   - Oracle DB 18c
   - Nginx
   - Testing
 - How to set env-vars for the following:
   - Dev
   - Test
   - Prod


## What will this app consist of

Pages
 - planner (send/revoke invites to people) 
 - guest (people create/update/delete) 
 - events (party create/update/delete) 
 - viewer (display info either tied to party or individual)
 - login page is a joke


UnitTest (need to learn about proper creation but v much interested)
 - Mocha
 - Selenium Cucumber in Js (super super cool)
